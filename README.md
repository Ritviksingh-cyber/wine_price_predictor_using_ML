# Wine Price Predictor

This repository contains a web application that predicts the price of wines based on their characteristics. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of wine reviews to make the predictions, and it provides a user interface built with Streamlit that allows users to enter the wine characteristics and get a price estimate.

## Features

Here are some of the features of this application:

- Price prediction: The application can predict the price of a wine based on its type, variety, country, region, and other characteristics.
- User interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows users to enter the wine characteristics and get a price estimate.
- Model performance: The machine learning model used in the application has an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

## Technologies

This application uses the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used to develop the application and train the machine learning model.
- Streamlit: A Python library for building web applications with simple Python scripts.
- Scikit-learn: A Python library for machine learning.

## Dataset

The machine learning model used in this application was trained on a dataset of wine reviews obtained from [this Kaggle dataset](link-to-kaggle-dataset). The dataset contains information about wine type, variety, country, region, and other characteristics, as well as the price of the wine.
